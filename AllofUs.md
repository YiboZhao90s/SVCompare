## Main Workflow 
This is an exploranary analysis to see what variants were called from different techniques, and compare the lists with the 1KG merged list of MUC5AC.  
Since uploading job to the serve takes quite a long time and I have not got familiar with the system. I copied them into work disk first then run vcf fromt here. This takes longer time but will make sure everything runs properly.  
I created a large work disk of 1TB to make sure the VCF files can be save properly.
